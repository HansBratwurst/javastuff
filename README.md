#java Repo

This repo is intended to collect and bundle **java** sourcecode.
Yet compiled code (and/or binarys) is *unwanted*, so sources only please.
So far this may be the only restriction, so feel free to commit *any*-purpose code.

## structure

To prevent chaos, *please* try to keep things in line.
So grouping libs in **directories** and **subdirectories** may be an idea here.
